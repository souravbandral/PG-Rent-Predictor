PG Rent Predictor

This project predicts PG/Hostel rent using Machine Learning techniques.
It helps users estimate rent based on multiple factors such as location,
area, BHK, distance, furnishing, and food availability.

Problem Statement:
Finding the right PG/Hostel at a reasonable rent is difficult due to
multiple influencing factors. This project solves the problem by using
a trained Machine Learning model.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Regressor

Workflow:
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Model training using Random Forest
3. Model evaluation
4. Rent prediction

Project Files:
- train_rent.py : Model training script
- app.py : Prediction application

This project was developed for academic and learning purposes.
